this project wants to simulate a login experience with a basic interface
where you can request random images, and if you like them, you can "approve"
the image displayed by clickind the appropriate button, or discard it and show
a new image.

The approved images goes into a little carousel, which you can browse with two arrows.
Then you can logout and return to the initial window by a logout button.

The application is designed for a mobile experience.
